Had to hard code certain parts to work on laptop.

CameraGUI_OpeningFcn
    mycam = char(caminfo.InstalledAdaptors(2));
    change number based on adaptor corresponding to camera


SelectROI_Callback
    height and width
        
remember to change SelectROI_Callback to check for boxes outside of negative side


problems with choosing and deleting boxes on the preview axes.


src.exposureMode = 'Auto' to src.exposureAuto = 'On'
(same with gain)


exposure and gain don't update on the bar, but they do change the camera.
