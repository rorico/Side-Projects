# Side-Projects 
Chrome Tools 
A google extension that helps me manage my time and schedule.

Here is where I upload any of my programming projects; this includes my major side-projects (Project Euler and Double Series), as well as other small tests I do.

Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/)
A series of complex math problems that are to be solved using math concepts and programming.

Double Series (rules:http://www.pagat.com/misc/jack.html)
I created a simulation of the game that follows all the rules. I also created multiple AIs that incorporate different strategies. You can play these AIs or have them face each other.

Mobile Schedule
A spinoff of Chrome Tools that is a webpage for usage on the phone.

URA (Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship)
Making an optical spectrometer. Contains matlab code for GUI and calculation for the camera data after light gets filtered by lenses.
