# Side-Projects

Here is where I uploaded my old programming projects.
Things I'm currently working on are probably in their seperate repo.

## Chrome Tools

A google extension that helps me manage my time and schedule.

## Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/)

A series of complex math problems that are to be solved using math concepts and programming.

## Double Series (rules:http://www.pagat.com/misc/jack.html)

I created a simulation of the game that follows all the rules. I also created multiple AIs that incorporate different strategies. You can play these AIs or have them face each other.
