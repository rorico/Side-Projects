# Side-Projects 
Here is where I upload any of my programming projects; this includes my major side-projects (Project Euler and Double Series), as well as other small tests I do.

Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/)
A series of complex math problems that are to be solved using math concepts and programming.

Double Series (rules:http://www.pagat.com/misc/jack.html)
I created a simulation of the game that follows all the rules. I also created multiple AIs that incorporate different strategies. You can play these AIs or have them face each other.
